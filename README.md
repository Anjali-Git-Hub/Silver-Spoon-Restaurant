# Spoon-Silver-Restaurant-

- Welcome ðŸ¤— to the Silver Spoon Restaurant website!

- I created this website using flexbox and incorporated CSS animations, keyframes, transitions, and the transform property.

- The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.

- For smaller screens, I implemented a hamburger menu using pure CSS.
  
-  I created image overlays which can be seen in the 'Types of Food' section. These overlays are made using before and after pseudo-elements.

- Additionally, I included a preloader that appears until the web content is fully loaded, providing a smooth user experience. Icons were added using Font Awesome classes.
