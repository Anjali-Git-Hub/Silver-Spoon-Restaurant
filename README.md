# Spoon-Silver-Restaurant-

- Welcome ðŸ¤— to the Silver Spoon Restaurant website!
- 
- I created this website using flexbox and incorporated CSS animations, keyframes, transitions, and the transform property.
- 
- The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- 
- For smaller screens, I implemented a hamburger menu using pure CSS.
- 
- Additionally, I included a preloader that appears until the web content is fully loaded, providing a smooth user experience. Icons were added using Font Awesome classes.
